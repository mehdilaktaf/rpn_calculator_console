# Getting started with RPN Calculator Console

This project was created using python and it's built-in functions.

## What is RPN ?

RPN stands for "Reverse Polish Notation". 

What we normally use to write an equation is called the infix notation, for example :
##### ((1 + 2) / 3)

This is the equivalent of this equation using the RPN : 

##### 1 2 + 3 /

## What can you use this calculator for?

The goal of this console application is to take in a RPN equation and compute it to give its result.
You will also see the infix notation before your result.

## Usage

Now that I explained the RPN and goal of this application, here is how to use it:\

#### `python rpn_calculator.py` 
After launching this application using the command line above you will need to type a valid RPN equation to get its result.

#### or

#### `python rpn_calculator.py "tokens"`
Where tokens is a valid RPN equation.
