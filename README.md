# Getting started with RPN Calculator Console

This project was created using python and its built-in functions.

## What is RPN ?

**RPN** stands for **"Reverse Polish Notation"** which is a notation for equation that does not use parenthesis, it is also known as ***postfix notation***. 

This is an example of an equation using the **Reverse Polish Notation** : 
### **`1 2 + 3 /`**

What we normally use to write this equation is called the ***infix notation***, it looks like this :
### **`((1 + 2) / 3)`**

## What can you use this calculator for?

The goal of this console application is to take in a RPN equation and compute it to give a result.
You will also see the infix notation before your result.

## Usage

Now that I explained the RPN and goal of this application, here is how to use it:

*You can launch this application using the command line below you will need to type a valid RPN equation to get a result.*

### **`python rpn_calculator.py`**
### **or**
### **`python rpn_calculator.py "tokens"`**

*Using the command line argument "tokens" you need to directly type a valid RPN equation.*
